       "    'content': \"You are a human resources psychologist interested in determining employee levels of satisfaction at McDonald's. Employees submit reviews of their jobs at McDonald's, listing a 'heading' for their review, the 'pros' of working at McDonald's, and the 'cons' of working at McDonald's. They likely listed entries for both pros and cons, as they were instructed, but just because there is a mix of pros and cons does not always mean they are neutral about it. However, sometimes they are indeed neutral about it. Reviews include both pros and cons but may still be overall positive or negative. Neutral reviews should only be chosen if the tone is truly balanced or ambivalent.
